    "I belive that humans are ultimately made from atoms and that we could rearrange the atoms correctly we can make a human, or a machine that can \"think\" just like a human.a  What is programming? as it seems that that is what causes alot of intellgience? If everything is rearranging atoms? Well a program is ultiatetmly symbols in a computer, \n",

    "A von nueman computer is a very special arrangment of atoms, that allows for computation. Programming, a very high level way in order to arrange, many, many atoms on a lower level. \n",

    "Can a machine think? Yes, it's possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Will we make machines that can think? We may, but I don't think it really matters. What we care about is the what not the how. Neuroscientist and for curoscanity, it may be interesting to know how the brain processes information, but captilism cares more about results IMO. \n",

    "I don't think anyone really knows how chat gbpt works, but we do care about what it can do, and I am told it works by AI. Artifhatical General intellgience is defined as making a machine that can do anything a human can do. Well, yes I think we can definetly achieve this. Will it be concious and self-aware? in the sense that we feel we have thoose things. 1, its suspect exactly what thoose things are, I don't think nessecaritly. \n",
    " \n",
    "I can imagine a program that can do everything a human can do, can do it better, but may not nessecarily be able to \"think\" in the way a human does. Perhaps this is what the quora user was saying about Searles Room\n",

    "I would predict we will treat them, as a \"concious\" being if they act conciously, so me aspect of common sense, and \"awarness\" of what is happening around them. Even humans can go on \"auto pilot\" often. Yes I can imagine, we could fall in love with a robot.  \n",

Functionality is certain cases is discontinous. its not like, kinda good oven, better oven, great oven. It's like not an oven, an oven, and then better ovens. It's like a RELU function.\n",
